# Implementing GCNs from Scratch

## Introduction

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful neural network architecture for processing data structured as graphs. 

Unlike traditional neural networks, GCNs leverage the graph topology and node feature information to learn representations that capture the complex relationships within the data. 

This project is dedicated to the hands-on implementation of GCNs from scratch, aimed at developers and researchers interested in deepening their understanding of graph neural networks. 

By building GCNs without relying on the high-level abstractions provided by popular deep learning frameworks, we can gain insights into the mechanics and challenges of working with graph-structured data.

## About The Project

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide to implementing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) from the ground up. 

By following along, users will understand the core components that make up a GCN, including:

- Graph convolution layers for feature propagation
- Non-linearity application between layers
- The significance of node features and edge information in graph learning

This implementation covers the basics yet forms the foundation for more complex graph-based learning tasks.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you're familiar with:

- Basics of graph theory
- Fundamentals of neural networks
- Python programming

Required software/libraries:

- Python (3.6 or newer)
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Majid-Dev786/Implementing-GCNs-from-Scratch.git
```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv gcn-env
source gcn-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `gcn-env\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy torch networkx matplotlib
```

## Usage

To run the GCN implementation on sample datasets and visualize the results:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python Implementing\ GCNs\ from\ Scratch.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to execute the model training and visualize the graph with node classifications.

## How It Works

This section provides a high-level overview of the key concepts behind Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and how they are implemented in this project. 

GCNs operate by applying graph convolutions that effectively aggregate and transform feature information from a node's neighborhood. 

This process allows the model to learn representations that capture both local structure and node features. 

Our implementation demonstrates these principles through practical coding examples, making complex ideas accessible to all interested learners.
